Well folks, to my knowledge and all that it's worth. I do not feel the need to elaborate much on ssecurity. 
Keep It Simple Stupid.
If you notice a true breach.. or gnomes start their pesky biznizz, JUST IGNORE IT AND DO NOT REPORT TO ANYONE EXCEPT WHEN DOING SO WILL SAVE A LIFE.
Questions, comments, concerns can be addressed publicly on this repository, and if they are about myself, my experience, my education, my employment, my unemployment
my criminal history, my passwords, my information, my slim knowledge of my ancestry, my mother 
(I will only speak on my opinion in regards to family... their careers are their own and I respect attorney/client confidentiality. Nor has either
parent ever disclosed any interesting thing about their work with myself), I will
discuss the conditions and procedures of various behavioral IOP, PHP,
And residential centers, I will discuss my former addiction and alcoholism, but I cannot
Disclose any ANONYMOUS information besides providing brochures containing publicly scheduled meetings. 
All of my experiences, good and bad, that have given me this gift of humanity, is by my own decisions.
I have never been coerced, bribed, briefed, asked, or tricked into choosing the paths that I have chosen.

And I'm proud.
